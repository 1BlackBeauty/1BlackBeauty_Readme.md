# *Just A Little Bit About Me*

*My name is **Danyel**, but you can call me **Danny**, and welcome to my **readme.md** repository. I am a novice when it comes to coding, and I have decided that does not sit well with me because I am the tech-savvy one in the family. So far, I have managed to adapt just as the many emerging technologies, navigating them with ease. **Everything except for coding**. Ultimately, I found GitHub and decided to use this platform as an extremely very valuable tool for expanding my knowledge about everything pertaining to coding (front & backend). I reside in **Columbus, OH (GO BUCKS)** and am freelancing at the moment (in between gigs at the moment), but seeking the next big thing like everyone else.* 

**Being a simple gal from the Midwest, I enjoy the simple things in life. Curling up with a good book or watching movies, writing short stories/poetry (never quite had the nerve to publish anything yet), and spending time with those who spend time with me. I have made it a goal to try and learn at least one new thing a day because why not?*
