## Just A Little Bit About Me

***Hey everyone welcome to my first-ever **readme.md** repository. I am just starting to learn about coding and the reason why is because I was doing some work training AI chatbots, and well the rest is history. Ultimately I found GitHub and figured this could be a very valuable tool in expanding my knowledge about everything and anything that has to deal with coding (front & backend). I am from Columbus, OH, attend college online for Criminal Justice, and enjoy reading, and writing short stories/poetry but have never published anything (one day), and trying to learn something new each and every day. If you have any questions feel free to ask and I just might have an answer to your question!***
